This temple lies on the road between the Nathula and Jelepla Pass approximately 64 km from Gangtok. A shrine was built at his samƒÅdhi, at an elevation of around 4,000 metres (13,123 ft).The legend of Baba goes back 35 years when Sepoy Harbhajan Singh of the 23rd Punjab Regiment went missing while leading a pack of mules from his battalion stationed at Tukla to Deng Dhukla, both remote areas located in East Sikkim. A manhunt was launched and it took the army three days to find his body. It is believed that he himself led the soldiers to the site. Soon after, soldiers in the regiment started reporting that Baba had been appearing in their dreams and directing that a shrine be built in his memory. A Samadhi was raised in his memory and believers say that even today Baba visits every night, puts on his uniform and does his rounds. He is worshipped as a saint who grants boons and guards the lives of soldiers posted along the border. The Army treats Baba as a soldier who never died. Over the years Sepoy Harbhajan Singh has been duly getting his rank until he retired recently. However, before his retirement it was believed that each year in September Baba would take his annual holiday and travel back to Kapurthala, his hometown. People gathered in large numbers and lined the route that Baba is believed to have taken to offer flowers and prayers. A berth on a train was reserved in his name and two orderlies would accompany him on the journey. The legend of this Sepoy-Saint grows stronger with each passing day.

Sikh shrine built at an elevation of 4,000 meters believed to have wish fulfilling powers. Devotees leave a bottle of water at the temple and pick it up on their return journey.
