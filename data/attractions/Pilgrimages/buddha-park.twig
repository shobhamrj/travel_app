On the birth anniversary of Lord Gautama Buddha in 2006 the state government took a policy decision to observe the birth anniversary throughout the year in Sikkim. And as a part of the celebration, the people of Ravangla took the initiative to construct and install a large statue of Lord Buddha and eco -garden to commemorate the event. This would also be a landmark in Sikkim’s unique effort to promote pilgrimage tourism. The Buddha Park hosts a beautiful statue of Sakyamuni Buddha which is clearly visible from all the directions of southwest Sikkim near Ravangla and some parts of west Sikkim. The park area is beautifully landscaped creating ample walkway, gardens and space for visitors to enjoy the serene surroundings. The site commands beautiful views of the mountains and the spiritual ambience of the location adds to the visitor experience. The site also has additional infrastructure created for a museum meditation centre and for Buddhist conclave.
