Saraswati Mandir is located opposite to the Central Referral Hospital and Sikkim Manipal Institute of Medical Sciences along the 31A National Highway. Local residents including students frequent the temple in the morning to offer their prayers. Even though the temple is located within the town itself and besides the main highway, it is still a quiet and calm location where visitors can relax and offer their prayers peacefully. Over the years this temple has gained popularity with the student’s community of Sikkim and tourists alike for Goddess Saraswati is regarded as Goddess of Knowledge. On the 5th day of ‘Phagun’ of the Nepali calendar, which according to English calendar falls any day between the last weeks of January to 2nd Week of February, Saraswati Puja is performed with much devotion and grandeur. It is believed on this day the student’s community offers text books, pens, pencils and other stationery items and offer their prayers to the Goddesses Saraswati and Dolma for their blessings. The unique feature of this temple is that both the Hindu and Buddhist devotees revere the Saraswati and Dolma deities that are placed together, further strengthening the social fabric of the local community.
This is a unique temple because both the Hindu and Buddhist Deities are kept together and prayers are performed by both Hindu Priest and Buddhist Monks.

Best to visit early in the morning and at the evening because even though the main gate remains open during the day, the central hall for prayers remains closed and opens only in the mornings and evenings and on special occasions.

Situated along the national highway ‘NH 31A’, the temple is easily accessible by local taxi, city runner (local buses), reserved taxi or private vehicles. It is a 5 minutes walking distance from the Sikkim Manipal Referral Hospital.
