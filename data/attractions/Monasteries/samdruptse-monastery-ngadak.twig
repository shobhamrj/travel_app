Samdruptse means 'The wish fulfilling hill' in local Bhutia language is a short distance uphill from Namchi, on Samdruptse hill, stand a giant statue of Guru Padmasambhava, gazing upon the town and across the hills. It is 45m tall and covered in shimmering gold, sparkles in the sun. It is an incredible feat of engineering, founded in 1997. The views are spectacular across and the statue can be seen from across many places in Sikkim and Darjeeling. Ngadak Monastery is one of the oldest monasteries of Namchi which was built by Tensung Namgyal, during the reign of Chogyal Gyurmed Namgyal regime. Belonging to as early as the 17th century, the word Ngadak actually means promise. Hence it is believed that anyone coming here would make a promise to come back again. This monastery was constructed as a palace to Her Highness Pendi Ongmu. It was damaged by an earthquake and is a testimony to old religious culture of Sikkim. A large new Gumpa is under construction at Ngadak as the old structure is ruined however it still exudes a sense of old Sikkim.
