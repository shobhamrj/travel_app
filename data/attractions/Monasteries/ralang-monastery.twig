Ralang Monastery is diminutive but fascinating old monastery located at a distance of about 8 km from Ravangla Town, at close proximity to the New Ralong Monastery or Palchen Choeling Monastic Institute. The traditional Bhutia houses scattered nearby and the lush green forest adds beauty to the monastery. The Monastery was built to venerate the triumphant pilgrimage of the fourth Chogyal (king) to Tibet. After his return, the Karmapa performed the Rabney or blessing. The grain that he threw from the Tsurphu Monastery in Tibet (the main seat of Karmapa) fell on the ground of Ralang and was witnessed by devotees. As such it became the site for the Ralang Monastery. Reconstruction work was carried out in this monastery by the government between the periods of 1975 -81. This old Ralang Monastery is one of the most important and sacred monasteries in Sikkim following the Kagyu tradition. A new monastery of Palchen Choeling Monastic Institute came up in the year 1995. It was constructed by the XIIth Gyaltsab Rimpoche who is regarded amongst the four regents of the Kagyu sect. Despite its recent construction, the monastery structure proves that meticulous care has been undertaken to maintain the authentic Tibetan architecture. The Monastery has an extensive collection of paintings and thangkas and is host to the annual festival Pang Lhabsol when Mount Khangchendzonga is worshipped usually falling in the month of August –September. Masked monastic dances are also organized every year, on the 15th day of the seventh month of the Buddhist calendar (August-September) and on the 29th day of the tenth month of the Buddhist calendar (December). The Mahakala Dance takes place every year in the month of November.
