The Bon faith flourished in Tibet up to the 8th Century AD prior to the advent of Buddhism. It is believed that many of its rituals were assimilated in Buddhism like the prayer flags, burning of incense etc. and with the passage of time this faith was also influenced by Buddhism and has now been accepted as a part of Buddhism. Current Bonpo followers practice a living doctrine dedicated at perpetuating the teaching of their founder Lord Tonpa Shenrab, who occupies a prominent position in Bon culture. Today Bon monasteries through the Himalayan region continue to serve as an integral part of their community Spiritual life. The Bon monastery at Kewzing, the only one of its kind in Sikkim was established in the latter half of 1980s and is a symbol of the determination of a community of people at Kewzing to preserve their religious traditions. Until Buddhism found its way from India in the 7th century, the Bon religion was the religion of Tibet. The belief in an Almighty God and in gods, spirits and demons living in nature belongs to the ancient elements of it. An interesting fact is that there are only two Bon monasteries in India; one in Himachal Pradesh and the other in the state of Sikkim. The monastery in Sikkim accommodates 20 monks to offer prayer in the main hall. The interior of the monastery is well decorated with fascinating paintings of Bon deities, Bon Demonical Buddha. The chanting of mantras, the drum beat and the blowing of conch in the morning and evening promises to revive the spiritualism within you. The ancient roots of Bon religion derive from a profound respect for nature and emphasize the healing of physical and environmental as well as spiritual afflictions. The Bon tradition can be experienced in this sole bon lineage monastery of Sikkim.
