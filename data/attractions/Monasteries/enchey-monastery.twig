Enchey Monastery is approximately 200 years old and is located 3 km northeast of Gangtok. It belongs to the Nyingma order of Vajrayana Buddhism. The location was blessed by Lama Drupthob Karpo, a renowned exponent of tantric art adept in Buddhism with flying powers. It is believed that initially a small Gompa was established by him after which he flew from Maenam Hill in South Sikkim to this site. The literal meaning of ‘Enchey Monastery’ is ‘the solitary temple’. It is also said that the Monk built a small hermitage at the site of the monastery, after he came here flying from Maenam Hill in South Sikkim. The present structure of the monastery was built during the reign of Sidkeong Tulku (1909-1910). Enchey Monastery today is a home to around 90 monks belonging to the Nyingma sect. It houses a number of images of Gods, Goddesses and religious objects. The Buddha, Loketeswara and Guru Padmasambhava are the three important deities worshipped in the monastery. Every year special prayers are held at the monastery on the18th, 19th day of the 12th lunar month of the Tibetan calendar, corresponding to the dates during January, February each year. January is the time for the vibrant and colorful “Chaam” or religious masked dance held at the Monastery.
