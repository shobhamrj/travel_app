Labrang Monastery is situated at Phodong of North Sikkim, it lies 2 km further uphill from Phodong Monastery. This is a much older structure in comparison. It also has a unique architecture and is one of the premier monasteries of Sikkim. To perpetuate the Nyingmapa School of ancient Tibetan Buddhism, the Labrang monastery was built by Gyalshe Rigzing Chempa in the memory of Latsun Chembo of Kongpu (Tibet).The monastery is encircled by an impassable forest and one would be mesmerized at the first sight of the monastery as it still retains its original structure in perfect condition. The monastery complex dominates the northern part of the village. The white walls and golden roofs feature a blend of Tibetan and Han architectural styles. The monastery contains 18 halls, six institutes of learning, a golden stupa, a sutra debate area, and houses nearly 60,000 sutras. There once were more than 2,000 monks in residence, but now only 500, due to a twelve year closure starting in 1958. It has a Buddhist museum with a large collection of Buddha statues, sutras and murals. In addition, a large amount of Tibetan language books, including books on history is available for purchase, together with medicines, calendars, music and art objects.
