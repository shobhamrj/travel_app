Gurudongmar Lake at a height of 17100 ft, is among the important high altitude lakes of Sikkim as well as of India. Named after Gurudongmar, the lake has a religious appeal and is considered to be a very sacred lake. The view of Mt. Sinolchu, Mt. Khangchendzonga and the surrounding mountains is breathtaking, especially with the snow clad mountain which look like it’s freshly painted. During spring, the valleys are filled with flowers especially Blue Poppy which is very rare species. Legend says that, Guru Padmasambhava (also known as Guru Dongmar), touched and sanctified the lake, and thus, even in extreme winter, a portion of the lake does not freeze. The lake is also one of the sources of River Teesta, which flows through Sikkim, West Bengal and Bangladesh to merge into the Bay of Bengal. The water of the lake is said to have curative properties and many tourists carry the water with them on their way back. Close to the lake, is a 'Sarva Dharma Sthal', and as the name suggests, it’s a place of worship for all religions. The closest village from Gurudongmar Lake is Thangu; at about 14000 ft. You need to be physically fit and more importantly mentally prepared for such high altitudes. Thin air and lack of oxygen supply can leave you wanting for more and more air all the time. But this challenge of hard terrain and the reward of glorious views of Gurudongmar lake makes this trip worthwhile for travelers.
