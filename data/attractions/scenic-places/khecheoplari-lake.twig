The Khecheopalri lake is situated at the meeting place of the roads of Gyanshng and Yoksum in West Sikkim. Set at 6,400 feet above the seal level, the lake brims with crystal clear water encircled by a dense forest. Local legend has it that not even a falling leaf is allowed to mar the beauty of the idyllic lake – a watchful bird will clear it away. Khecheopalri means wish-fulfilling lake and the Sikkimese people hold it sacred. The Khecheopalri Monastery is just a 10-minute walk from the lake. Trek up one-and-half  km and take a look below. The Khecheopalri Lake will appear as a footprint, pure and pristine. Maybe, it is the Almighty’s footstep.
