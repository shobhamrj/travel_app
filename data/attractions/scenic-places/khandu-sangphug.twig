Alongside the Phurcha Tshu hot water spring, Khando Sangphu cave, one amongst the four important caves in Sikkim is located. The appellation of the word Kahandu Sangphu is “Secret cave of the dakinis”. With its varying heights from two to twenty five feet, one has to literally crawl to reach the cave. Legend has to say that people who get stuck inside the cave are considered to be sinners. According to an ancient mythology, the Great Buddhist Guru, Padmasambhava had dwelled in the cave in search of enlightenment. During his stay in the cave he killed a demoness that had been an obstruction in his spiritual pursuit. At the remote end of the cave, one can see a normal person sitting in a meditative posture. A deep imprint seen on the roof above is believed to be an impression of Guru Padmasambhava’s crown when he had meditated in this cave. It is a belief that the rock above the door is the body of a nun that was transformed into the rock by Guru Rimpoche. It is said that Padmasambhava liberated her in this way to inspire future generations who would see the rock. After passing the gate and entering an inner patio, as you face the stairs that lead up to the cave, there is a path on the left that leads to a hole. It is said that, if you can pass through that hole, all your obscurations will be purified. Also, according to the oral tradition, from above the cave itself there are underground passages that lead to another cave, The Hidden Cave in the East.
