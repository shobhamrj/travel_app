Tashi View Point is approximately 8 kilometer away from Gangtok town situated along the North Sikkim Highway near Pangthang. The View Point offers splendid view of Khangchendzonga Mountain Range and the distant villages of North Sikkim. On a clear day mountains are seen in splendor, especially at dawn when the sun’s rays hits the mountain peaks, it displays glory in shades of pink, orange, gold and finally white. This panoramic site was built by the late King of Sikkim. The Tourism Department has constructed a resting shed, a park and a small cafeteria for visitors. On a clear day, not only are the mountain ranges seen but one can see the Labrang and Phodong monasteries embedded amidst the lush green backdrop.
