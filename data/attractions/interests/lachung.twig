The picturesque mountain village of Lachung is embraced by snow capped mountain peaks, breathtaking waterfalls, sparkling streams and apple orchards. Sprawled across the banks of the Lachung Chu [river] which divides the village in two, Lachung is famous for its apples, peaches and apricots. But despite throwing its doors open to tourists Lachung still retains its distinctive culture and tradition, including the unique system of self governance called the Dzumsa. The valley is also home to one of the most beautiful rhododendron sanctuaries in Sikkim, the Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary which houses more than forty species of the rhododendron. Other high altitude flora and fauna are the highlights of the sanctuary. Lachung is perfect for an overnight halt before you visit the spectacular Yumthang valley. Set at an elevation of 3575 meters above sea level, the Yumthang Valley is Sikkim's undisputed natural paradise that is easily accessible via road. The hot springs and the valley of flowers is worth a visit for travelers making a trip to Lachung.
